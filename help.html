                  <div class="question">1. How is wine made?</div>
                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Wine is made from fermented grapes. The grapes are
                    crushed, and the juice is fermented with yeast to produce
                    alcohol.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: The main types of wine are red, white, and
                    sparkling. Each type is made from different grape varieties
                    and has its unique characteristics.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Pair wine with food by considering the wine's flavor
                    and the dish's ingredients. For example, red wine pairs well
                    with red meat, while white wine complements seafood and
                    poultry.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Red wine is made from dark-colored grape varieties,
                    with the skins included during fermentation, giving it its
                    red color and bolder flavors. White wine is made from green
                    or yellow grapes, with the skins removed, resulting in a
                    lighter color and crisper taste.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: The storage time for wine depends on the type.
                    Generally, most wines are best enjoyed within 1 to 5 years
                    of purchase. However, some high-quality red wines can
                    improve with several years of aging.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: White wine is typically served chilled. The ideal
                    temperature varies by type, but a range of 45째F to 55째F (7째C
                    to 13째C) is a good starting point.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Most white wines are best enjoyed relatively young
                    and don't benefit from aging like red wines. However, some
                    high-quality white wines, like certain Chardonnays and
                    Rieslings, can improve with a few years of cellaring.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Champagne is a type of sparkling wine produced in
                    the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wine refers to
                    similar wines produced in other regions. Both undergo a
                    secondary fermentation process to create bubbles, but only
                    Champagne can be called "Champagne."

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: To decant wine, carefully pour it from the bottle
                    into a decanter. This helps aerate the wine and separate any
                    sediment. Allow red wines to breathe for about 30 minutes,
                    while lighter wines may need less time.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: A dry wine has minimal residual sugar, resulting in
                    a less sweet taste. A sweet wine contains more sugar, which
                    imparts a sweeter flavor. The level of sweetness can vary
                    widely among wine types.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: To open a bottle of wine, use a wine opener, such as
                    a corkscrew or a waiter's key. Insert the corkscrew into the
                    cork, turn it clockwise, and gently pull the cork out.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: A wine is considered corked if it has a musty, moldy
                    smell and a damp cardboard-like taste. This is usually
                    caused by a contaminated cork.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: Tannins are natural compounds found in grape skins,
                    seeds, and stems. They create a dry, astringent sensation in
                    the mouth and are more prevalent in red wines, contributing
                    to their structure and aging potential.

                  <div class="answer">
                    Answer: To preserve open wine bottles, reseal them with a
                    wine stopper and store them in the refrigerator. Red wines
                    can be stored for a few days, while white wines may last a
                    bit longer.

                    Answer: Organic wines are made from grapes grown without

                    Answer: The vintage on a wine label indicates the year the

                    quality, as each vintage varies due to weather conditions.

                    sparkling wine stopper can help maintain the carbonation.
